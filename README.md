This project is a clean, responsive landing page for a fictional company called **Huddle**. It features semantic HTML structure, light/dark theme support, accessible navigation, and polished styling with CSS custom properties.

Created as part of the building challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).

---

## 🔍 Overview

The Huddle Landing Page challenge provided a mockup to recreate using only HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript. The final build includes a functional dark mode toggle with smooth transitions, accessible skip links, and responsive layout optimized for both mobile and desktop viewports.

The project uses semantic elements throughout, respects accessibility best practices, and adapts to user preference for reduced motion. Google Lighthouse was used to verify performance, accessibility, and SEO.
